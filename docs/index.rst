Welcome to Triton-distributed's documentation!
==============================================

Triton-distributed is a distributed compiler designed for computation-communication overlapping, which is based on OpenAI Triton.

Using Triton-distributed, programmers are able to develop efficient kernels comparable to highly-optimized libraries (including `Distributed-GEMM <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/65_distributed_gemm>`_ and `FLUX <https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/README.md>`_). Triton-distributed currently mainly targets Nvidia GPU and AMD GPU. It can also be ported to other hardware platforms. Feel free to contact us if you want to use Triton-distributed on your own hardware.


Getting Started
---------------

- Follow the :doc:`installation instructions <getting-started/installation>` for your platform of choice.
- Take a look at the :doc:`tutorials <getting-started/tutorials/index>` to learn how to write your first Triton-distributed program.
- Explore our :doc:`end-to-end integration <getting-started/e2e/index>` to learn how Triton-Distributed accelerates inference for real-world LLMs.
- Try our :doc:`megakernel implementations <getting-started/megakernel/index>` to learn how Triton-Distributed accelerates inference for real-world LLMs.
