<<<<<<< HEAD

## rocSHMEM 3.0.0 for ROCm 7.0.0

=======
* `rocshmem_ptr`  can now return non-null pointer to
   a shared memory region when the IPC transport is available to reach that region.
   Previously, it would return a null pointer.
* `ROCSHMEM_RO_DISABLE_IPC` was renamed to `ROCSHMEM_DISABLE_MIXED_IPC`.
  This enviroment variable was not documented for prior releases.
  It is now documented to inform users who were using this undocumented feature.

### Removed
* rocSHMEM no-longer requires rocPRIM and rocThrust as dependencies
* Removed MPI compile-time dependency

### Known issues
* Only a subset of rocSHMEM APIs are implemented for the GDA conduit

* Added new APIs:
   * `rocshmem_ctx_barrier`
   * `rocshmem_ctx_barrier_wave`
   * `rocshmem_ctx_barrier_wg`
   * `rocshmem_barrier_all`
   * `rocshmem_barrier_all_wave`
   * `rocshmem_barrier_all_wg`
   * `rocshmem_ctx_sync`
