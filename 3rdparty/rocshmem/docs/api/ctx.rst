Context management routines
-----------------------------------

ROCSHMEM_CTX_CREATE
-------------------

.. cpp:function:: __device__ int rocshmem_wg_ctx_create(int64_t options, rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)
.. cpp:function:: __device__ int rocshmem_wg_team_create_ctx(rocshmem_team_t team, long options, rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)
        
  :param team:    Team handle to derive the context from.
  :param options: Options for context creation. Ignored in current design; use the value ``0``.
  :param ctx:     Context handle.
 
  :returns:       All threads returns ``0`` if the context was created successfully.
                  If any thread returns non-zero value, the operation fails and a higher number of
                  ``ROCSHMEM_MAX_NUM_CONTEXTS`` is required.

**Description:**
This routine creates an OpenSHMEM context. By design, the context is private to the calling work-group.
It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group.

ROCSHMEM_CTX_DESTROY
--------------------

.. cpp:function:: __device__ void rocshmem_wg_ctx_destroy(rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)

  :param ctx:     Context handle.

  :returns:       None.

**Description:**
This routine destroys an rocSHMEM context.
It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group.
