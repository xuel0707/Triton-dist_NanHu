Context management routines

ROCSHMEM_CTX_CREATE
-------------------

.. cpp:function:: __device__ int rocshmem_wg_ctx_create(int64_t options, rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)
.. cpp:function:: __device__ int rocshmem_wg_team_create_ctx(rocshmem_team_t team, long options, rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)
<<<<<<< HEAD
        
  :param team:    Team handle to derive the context from.
  :param options: Options for context creation. Ignored in current design; use the value ``0``.
  :param ctx:     Context handle.
 
  :returns:       All threads returns ``0`` if the context was created successfully.
                  If any thread returns non-zero value, the operation fails and a higher number of
                  ``ROCSHMEM_MAX_NUM_CONTEXTS`` is required.

**Description:**
This routine creates an OpenSHMEM context. By design, the context is private to the calling work-group.
It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group.

  :param team:    Team handle to derive the context from.
  :param options: Options for context creation. Ignored in current design; use the value ``0``.
  :param ctx:     A handle to the newly created context.

  :returns:       All threads returns ``0`` if the context was created successfully.
                  If any thread returns non-zero value, the operation fails, ctx is set to ``ROCSHMEM_CTX_INVALID`` and a
                  higher number of ``ROCSHMEM_MAX_NUM_CONTEXTS`` is required.

**Description:**
This routine creates an rocSHMEM context. By design, the context is private to the calling work-group.
It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group. If the context was created successfully, a value
of zero is returned and the context handle pointed to by ctx specifies a valid context; otherwise, a nonzero value
is returned and ctx is set to ``ROCSHMEM_CTX_INVALID``. An unsuccessful context creation call is not treated as an
error and the rocSHMEM library remains in a correct state. The creation call can be reattempted after additional
resources become available.

ROCSHMEM_CTX_DESTROY
--------------------

.. cpp:function:: __device__ void rocshmem_wg_ctx_destroy(rocshmem_ctx_t *ctx)

  :param ctx:     Context handle.

  :returns:       None.

**Description:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
This routine destroys an rocSHMEM context.
It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group.
=======
This routine destroys an rocSHMEM context. It must be called collectively by all threads in the work-group.
If ctx has the value ``ROCSHMEM_CTX_INVALID``, no operation is performed.

ROCSHMEM_GET_DEVICE_CTX
-----------------------

.. cpp:function:: __host__ void * rocshmem_get_device_ctx()

  :param:    None.

  :returns: Returns ``ROCSHMEM_CTX_DEFAULT`` device pointer that users.
            can query from one instance of rocSHMEM host library and
            use later for dynamic module initialization in
            kernel bitcode device library in the same application.

**Description:**
This routine queries rocSHMEM default device context from host API.
